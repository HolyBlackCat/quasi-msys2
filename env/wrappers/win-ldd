# We pipe the output of `ntldd` through sed to replace any windows-style paths with linux-style ones.
# Sed generates a sequence of bash commands, which are then piped to bash.
# 1: To escape ' symbols, replace then with '"'"'.
# 2: Wrap each line in `echo '...'`. This is why the previous line is necessary.
# 3: Find lines that look like valid ldd output (`  X => Y (0x123)`). For those lines, replace a single `echo` with a sequence of `echo`s that
#    prints everything verbatim except for Y, which is sent through `winepath -u` to convert to linux-style path, and then through `realpath` to resolve symlinks.
# The resulting sequence of commands is piped to `bash`. Remove `| bash` to debug.
